Journaling, blogging, and copywriting are things I've enjoyed all my life.
But lately, or rather for the past couple of years, I’ve hardly gotten around to doing any of it.

The advent of generative AI hasn’t helped my cause either. I’ve gotten so used to having LLMs generate, proofread, and generally leave their mark on my content that writing on my own has become a bit of a lost art. Not to say I don’t advocate for LLMs and their use cases. In fact, parts of this site were written with their help. It fascinates me that somehow we’ve managed to get grains of sand to think, but at the same time there’s always that lingering existential dread of losing to 0s & 1s.

This stings a bit because there was a time when I took real pride in my writing. I used to draft all sorts of things for my clubs and organizations, from FAQs to Terms and Conditions, from drawing up contracts to social media posts.

If I had to pick a time when I enjoyed writing the most, it would be when I scripted a play at my university. Without going too much into detail, it revolved around two guys arguing over what movie to watch. There were a couple of dances, a beatboxer, and to wrap it all up, a ramp walk reminiscent of Om Shanti Om. That event was probably the last time we got to do something like that, a last dance so to speak ~

Fast forward a few years, my writing has seen better days. Haven't written anything worthwile for some time now. As it turns out, HeyDarsh.in is due for a facelift, and I’ve been wanting a blog for ages (cough.. GitHub Pages Jekyll blog ..cough). So I figured I might as well add another section here. Nothing like one for all.

And here we are. The section is up and running. Hopefully, I’ll push contributions 𝖾̶𝗏̶𝖾̶𝗋̶𝗒̶ 𝗆̶𝗈̶𝗇̶𝗍̶𝗁̶ (proofreader Darsh here, turns out I might have to redact that claim). I have a few more ramblings in mind, mostly from my _Between Jobs™_ era. I taught myself DSA, attended interviews, and developed a project or two. A rough yet introspective time. Would not recommend, but lots to talk about.

That being said, I’m really glad I was able to make some time to work on this and look forward to the next post!
